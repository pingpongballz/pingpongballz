### Hello!

Im currently an EE grad student so i suck at actual coding :slightly_smiling_face:

I enjoy doing electronics stuff, mainly electronics that don't require coding (analog electronics, etc)

I do microcontroller programming, but only if I have to :upside_down_face:

If you would like to reach out to me for anything, email me at yftan@nus.edu.sg
